SP-ARK404

A modern open-source software homage to the legendary Roland SP-404SX, capturing the iconic lo-fi workflow in code.Built from scratch with JUCE (C++), this project recreates the immediate, hands-on magic of 12 pads × 10 banks, vinyl simulation, filter + drive, and that essential resampling vibe, while adding modern software advantages. The SpiritNot a clone, but a spiritual successor: Instant performance feel with big clickable pads
Signature gritty, warm sound through emulated effects
Resampling workflow at the core, capture anything, assign anywhere
Non-destructive editing, unlimited undo, plugin support

All original code, full respect for the inspiration, zero infringement. 

Core Features 

Current: 12-pad grid with bank switching (120 sample slots)
Sample loading and velocity-sensitive triggering

Planned: Full resampling engine (capture master output to new pad)
More SP-inspired effects (DJFX Looper, Isolator, Subsonic)
Sequencer modes (Classic real-time + Expanded step/piano roll)
VST3/AU plugin + standalone app builds
Lo-fi preamp stage for that converter warmth

Tech StackJUCE — Cross-platform audio framework (audio, GUI, plugins)
